================

I've completed a Fullstack Javascript Program at Portland Code School.

This little project is to teach myself HTML/CSS/website testing and debugging!

Note to self (put this on a blog somewhere):

- start with mobile layout
- add media queries (responsive design)
- take screen shot, load into Photoshop:
  - color saturation
  - black and white (check contrast)
  - blur
  - flip upside down (symmetry)

- test on tablets, smartphone, etc (or screen shot service)
- test different browers
- Validate HTML and CSS: validator.w3.org
